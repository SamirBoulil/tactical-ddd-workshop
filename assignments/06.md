# Design application services to interact with domain objects

- Define the following command classes:
    - `ScheduleMeetup`
    - `RsvpYes`
- Rewrite the sandbox script to make use of command objects and command handlers instead of making directly modifying domain objects.
- Optionally write Behat scenarios for the use cases of this application.
