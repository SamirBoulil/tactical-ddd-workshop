# Build up a read model

So far, our aggregates are perfect *write models*: they don't have any query methods.

We would like to know something about our domain objects though. For example, we want to be able to answer the following question:

> How many times has <user ID> replied "yes" to a meetup?

We don't need to do any complicated queries to answer this question, as long as we continuously keep track of every time a user submits "RSVP yes". In that case we could simply increment a counter for that particular user. Also, whenever this user changes their RSVP to "no" again (only if they *change* it, not if it's their first answer), we should decrement the counter to reflect the latest changes to the *write model*.

Now, create event subscribers which listen to the relevant events and update a simple read model (maybe just an array of which the keys are user IDs and the values are the counter for the number of RSVP "yes"s).
