# Create properly bounded contexts

We currently work in one context: the `MeetupOrganizing` context. We can see some concepts becoming stretched, like `User`. When organizing a meetup, we're talking not about "users" but about "organizers". The same for `Rsvp`: someone who says "yes, I'll attend", is called an "attendee", not a "user".

A "user" is only relevant in the context of "meetup membership".

## Consequences

- User-related classes should be moved to their own root namespace, `MeetupMembership`, which manages accounts and paid memberships (which are required for being an organizer).

## Questions

- How would you be able to use the actual identifiers from the `MeetupMembership` context inside the `MeetupOrganizing` context? After all, it should be possible to match these, to find out which users are actually organizers, or if an organizer is an existing user who paid their bills, etc.

The instructor will show you the full implementation for integrating the new (bounded) contexts.
