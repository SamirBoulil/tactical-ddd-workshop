# Notify group members about a scheduled meetup

## Briefing by the domain expert

Whenever a meetup has been scheduled we need to notify every group member of it. At least we'll send them an email, but once we have our mobile app ready, we should also send a push notification to the member's phone.

## Consequences

- Scheduling a meetup should trigger the recording of a domain event.
- A subscriber for this particular event is going to collect the email addresses of users who are in fact a member of the meetup group this meetup was scheduled for.
