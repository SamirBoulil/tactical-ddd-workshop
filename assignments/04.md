# Implement a persistence-based repository using an event store

## Storing events

- Events should be serializable to a string.
- Events should carry the ID of the aggregate they belong to.
- When the repository saves an aggregate, it retrieves new events from the aggregate and stores them instead.
 
## Reconstituting the aggregate

- An aggregate can be retrieved from the repository by its ID.
- The repository retrieves all the aggregate's events from the even store.
- A static `reconstitute()` method on the aggregate receives the deserialized domain events for the aggregate. It uses the events to restore its last known state.

## Hints:

- As a quick solution you could use PHP's native `serialize()` and `unserialize()` functions to convert events to strings and back again.
- You can assume that the events need no sorting.
- You don't have to think about concurrent updates for now.
