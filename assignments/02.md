# Redesigning the Meetup aggregate

## Briefing by the domain expert

After an RSVP has been posted, a user should be able to change their answer (from "yes" to "no" and vice versa).

## Consequences

- We have to implement the `Rsvp` class as an entity.

## Hints

- It won't be a child entity, but an aggregate on its own.
