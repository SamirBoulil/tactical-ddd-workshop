# Redesigning the Meetup aggregate

## Briefing by the domain expert

After a meetup comment has been posted, the author of the comment should be able to edit the comment, for example to fix typos.

- We have to implement the `Comment` class as an entity.

## Hints

- It won't be a child entity, but an aggregate on its own.
