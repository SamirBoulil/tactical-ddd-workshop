# Design the Meetup aggregate

## Briefing by the domain expert

A meetup is a get-together organized by a particular meetup group. When a meetup organiser wants to schedule a meetup, it needs to provide at least a working title (e.g. the name of the talk or workshop that is planned) and the meetup itself should be scheduled for a particular date and time (even though it might be rescheduled later). This way, people can at least save the preliminary date.

When the meetup has been scheduled, users can post comments on the meetup page. For example, people can use a comment to ask a question, or to anticipate the meetup in any other way.

## Consequences

- We have to implement a `Meetup` class.
- We have to implement a `Comment` class.

## Hints

- A meetup should be linked to the person who scheduled it as well as the meetup group it belongs to. A `User` and `Group` entity have already been defined for this purpose.
- Prefer value objects over (child) entities.
- No need to create a repository yet.
- Use `Uuid::uuid4()` to generate unique identities.
- Consider the need for an identity class.
- Write tests or if you're not familiar with that, manually test your stuff in a simple `sandbox.php` (this code isn't going to end up in production ;)).
