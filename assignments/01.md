# Design the Meetup aggregate

## Briefing by the domain expert

A meetup is a get-together organized by a particular meetup group. When a meetup organiser wants to schedule a meetup, it needs to provide at least a working title (e.g. the name of the talk or workshop that is planned) and the meetup itself should be scheduled for a particular date and time (even though it might be rescheduled later). This way, people can at least save the preliminary date.

When the meetup has been scheduled, users can respond to the RSVP with a "yes" or a "no". The organiser of the meetup always RSVPs with a "yes".

## Consequences

- We have to implement a `Meetup` class.
- We have to implement an `Rsvp` class.

## Hints

- Prefer value objects over (child) entities.
- A meetup should be linked to the person who scheduled it as well as the meetup group it belongs to. `User` and `MeetupGroup` entity classes have already been defined for this purpose.
- No need to create a repository yet.
- Use value objects for identities.
- Use `Uuid::uuid4()` to generate unique identities.
- Consider the need for an identity class.
- Write tests or if you're not familiar with that, manually test your stuff in a simple `sandbox.php` (this code isn't going to end up in production ;)).
