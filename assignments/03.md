# Implement automatic Rsvp "yes" for the organizer

Since we now create separate `Meetup` and `Rsvp` aggregates, the `Meetup` aggregate can't "rsvp yes" for the organizer immediately, that is, within one transaction. It should happen in another transaction. So this business rule be enforced in an eventually consistent way.
  
## Consequences

- Scheduling a meetup should trigger the recording of a domain event. You can "record" it in an internal array of event objects.
- In the sandbox you should be able to take out the events from the `Meetup` aggregate by calling some method on it.
- A subscriber for this particular event is going to create the `Rsvp` aggregate for the organizer.

## Hints

- In the sandbox an instantiated event dispatcher is already available. You can register event subscribers to it by providing the full class name as the name of the event.
- No need to implement full event-sourcing (yet).
