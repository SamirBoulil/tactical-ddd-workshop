# Add a location attribute to a meetup

The location of a meetup consists of an address (a single string, which doesn't have to be validated) and an exact location, in terms of a latitude and longitude (both will be floats).

Consider which values should be a consistent whole and will always change together. Define some constraints, like:

- The address shouldn't be empty.
- The latitude should be at least ... and at most ...
- The longitude should be at least ... and at most ...
- ...

Now design value objects to encapsulate the data as well as these rules. Make sure you write unit tests, proving that the objects can only be constructed in valid ways.

Finally, add the location as an attribute to the `Meetup` entity. Consider the following scenario: we can schedule a meetup without knowing the location yet. So we need two ways of assigning a location: when we schedule it, or afterwards, when we found a location for it (and maybe even a third way: what if we want to relocate it?).
